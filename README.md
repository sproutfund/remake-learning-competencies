# Remake Learning Competencies

Competencies are specific and observable learning outcomes. The goal of competency-based learning is to ensure that students are able to demonstrate knowledge, skills, and dispositions that are important to success in school, higher education, careers, and life.

The Remake Learning Competencies form the foundation of learning pathways that connect students to opportunities offered by schools, afterschool programs, cultural organizations, and online learning resources. By working together across boundaries, organizations offering learning experiences—in school, out of school, and online—can create pathways to opportunity for all students.

From September 2014 to February 2015, members of the [Remake Learning Network](http://remakelearning.org/network) in Pittsburgh worked together to establish shared learning competencies in conjunction with the creation of a city-wide digital badge and experience discovery platform, [Pittsburgh City of Learning](http://pghcityoflearning.org/).

[Cities of Learning](http://citiesoflearning.org/) is a national movement to harness the assets of a community and transform it into a network of seamless pathways of in-school, out-of-school, and online experiences—enabling young people to explore their interests, develop new skills, and connect their learning to real world opportunities.

The competencies were developed through the active engagement of more than 100 local subject matter experts, informal and formal educators, youth workers, and program managers. Multiple meetings, led by a team of trained facilitators, harnessed the diverse knowledge and expertise of these community members. The results are organized into 7 centers of programmatic excellence within the Pittsburgh community: [Career Readiness](https://sproutfund.github.io/remake-learning-competencies/#career-readiness), [Coding & Gaming](https://sproutfund.github.io/remake-learning-competencies/#coding-gaming), [Design & Making](https://sproutfund.github.io/remake-learning-competencies/#design-making), [Media Making](https://sproutfund.github.io/remake-learning-competencies/#media-making), [Robotics](https://sproutfund.github.io/remake-learning-competencies/#robotics), [STEAM](https://sproutfund.github.io/remake-learning-competencies/#steam), and [Early Childhood Education](https://sproutfund.github.io/remake-learning-competencies/#early-childhood-education). An eighth working group was convened to craft an outreach strategy for raising awareness about digital badges among learners, teachers, parents, and stakeholders.

In addition to the expert-led working group process, the competencies received feedback through a large-scale, half-day-long public forum attended by more than 300 educators and 100 high school students and through a final round of digital surveys. At the conclusion of the process, professional writers edited the competencies to ensure consistency in language and tone and graphic designers created visual representations to accompany each competency.

In 2015, these competencies will serve as the foundation for dozens of community partners joining Pittsburgh City of Learning as they create individual knowledge, skill, and disposition badges for their unique programs. Next, Remake Learning seeks to construct a network map of shared competencies in innovative learning programs, digital badges that are used to recognize learning and achievement, and in-person and online experiences that cultivate these competencies in young people in the greater Pittsburgh region.

By broadly sharing both the final competencies as well as the process undertaken by educators to yield them, it is hoped that other communities implementing local badge systems will benefit from Pittsburgh’s prior work and pursue their own community conversations informed by this experience.

This work was made possible through the generous support of the [Henry L. Hillman Foundation](http://hillmanfamilyfoundations.org/foundations/henry-l-hillman-foundation/) Opportunity Fund and led by the staff of [The Sprout Fund](http://www.sproutfund.org/), which serves as the steward of the Remake Learning Network, Hive Learning Network, and City of Learning in Pittsburgh.
